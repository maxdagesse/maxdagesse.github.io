<h3>Narrative</h3>
<p>
	The project I selected for this artifact was a hash table searcher that I made in C++ as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms class. It was designed to pull bids from an external table and sort them using a tree structure, which could then be searched later using IDs assigned to each bid using a hash table. Each of the program’s functions also had a simple timer attached to it, which tracks the amount of time the search takes to find the correct result. The search terms were hardcoded in this initial version of the program; you could find and delete one bid, and pull data from one file out of the two included. The program was the culmination of several weeks of work in which we learned about and implemented each of the major components of this project one by one, and it ended up being a fairly involved program that demonstrated a number of useful skills that I would use in many of the classes that followed it.
</p>
<p>
	It is for precisely that reason that I selected this program as part of my portfolio; the skills I learned in this class would prove to be foundational and are all things that I wanted to place in a position of importance, as well as continuing to build further on other skills that I’d learned already. Much like my last artifact, this program is capable of accepting data from an external file, which is a useful skill to show off. This project also demonstrated my skills with data structures and algorithms quite effectively. Even more so than the last project, it also demonstrates modularity; portions of this project can very easily be excised and used in other similar projects with full functionality maintained. This is definitely something I want to show off. Finally, as I mentioned in my last narrative, I deliberately chose projects in multiple coding languages to show off my talents with multiple languages; this project is the one for C++. My enhancements for this particular artifact went in several major directions. The first planned route was to tweak my algorithm and attempt to improve on it; however, I made little headway going in this direction. Thankfully, this was actually for a good reason; it seems that I had underestimated my initial work on this project going in, and the algorithm was already remarkably efficient. While I believe I made a few successful tweaks, they shaved microseconds off at most. The greater amount of legwork in enhancements came from two functionality improvements that I made. The first of these was the addition of an input for the search and delete functions that overrode the hardcoded search term; this allowed the user to find a bid of their choice and genuinely make use of the program’s functions. The second was a switch on the loading function that allowed the user to pick between the two files included to load, or input their own if they had a properly formatted file. These two features put together make the program a genuinely useful tool that demonstrates my proficiency with data structures and algorithms quite effectively.
</p>
<p>
	I didn’t quite meet the goals I set in Module One with this enhancement, but I’m not overly bothered by that for the reasons stated above about my failure to significantly improve my algorithm. As far as I can tell, my results with this artifact indicate that my algorithm didn’t actually need heavy improvement; I’m still quite happy with the end result and the enhancements I made in functionality. The program now serves as an effective and useful demonstration of my skills, which is more than I could have ever asked for. I did make some headway on algorithm improvement, even; it’s just not nearly as much as I thought I would, but not for a bad reason.
</p>
<p>
	As noted above, I did have some trouble with this enhancement due to my lack of ability to significantly improve my algorithm. I did a lot of research looking into why that turned out to be the case, and ended up learning a fair bit more than I already did about what makes an algorithm efficient in the first place, and why mine was already so remarkably effective. Having come away from the issue with a lot more knowledge than I started, I’m not particularly upset about my “failure”. Rather, I’m glad that I will be able to make use of this knowledge and algorithm in the future, and even more happy than I already was to showcase it in my portfolio. Overall, I’m quite happy with how this artifact turned out.
