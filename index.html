	My name is Max Dagesse, and I would like to take this moment to welcome you to my portfolio of work. Here, I have compiled some of the projects that I think best exemplify the skills I have learned as part of Southern New Hampshire University’s online computer science program. Before you begin to browse my artifacts, I would like to take a moment to discuss what I have learned throughout the program and what I hope this portfolio demonstrates to a potential employer.

	My coursework throughout this program has helped to showcase my strengths in computer science in a number of ways. A number of projects throughout this course have required me to work with other students to accomplish larger goals, such as my Software Development Lifecycle and Collaboration and Team Project classes. Classes and projects like these have helped me to effectively demonstrate my ability to perform in a team environment, working with others to accomplish larger goals that we couldn’t on our own. These classes also taught me about the importance of being able to communicate every element of a project to stakeholders when needed, as this can help to keep the project running smoothly and without delay. I had a particular focus on security features as part of my program, with a concentration in information security. Classes like Secure Coding, Network Security, and Cybersecurity gave me an excellent foundation to build on over the course of my career, with tools and techniques being of particular emphasis. Foundation in Application Development, Software Testing Automation and QA, and Computational Graphics and Visualization have taught me much about the engineering of software tools that will help me in my work. In the information security field, knowledge of database tools and how to work with and protect them is of paramount importance, and my classes in SQL and MongoDB have given me effective knowledge of two of the most widely used tools and a foundation on which to build even greater skill. Many of my classes, including Data Structures and Algorithms, Secure Coding,  and Operating Environments, have contributed to my ability to use data structures and algorithms effectively in the programs I make, allowing them to efficiently use and store data to make my work easier. All of these skills will be of use to me in the information security field, and are of much use to any potential employer.

	Overall, my selection of artifacts is informed by the traits that I want my portfolio to show off as a whole, traits that I think will be valuable to prospective employers. My chosen artifacts are each programmed in a different language; one in C++, one in Java, and one in Python. This was a deliberate decision, as it allows me to show my capabilities with three different coding languages, a set of skills that I believe to be valuable. In addition to the skills demonstrated by each individual artifact, the collective whole should demonstrate my capacity for effective and easily parse-able code; each of my projects demonstrates my due diligence in coding essentials. I comment thoroughly, making it easier for other viewing my work to identify what each section of the program does and follow along if they need to work on it. I separate the various elements of code into “blocks” that are easily identifiable in function, and can be effectively reused in other projects if need be, showing that my code is highly modular. My goal in any project is to create code that is easily legible, functional, and reusable, and I would hope that my portfolio can demonstrate this effectively. In addition, the collective whole, along with enhancements, should show my capacity to learn new skills quickly and effectively; computer science is a lifelong learning endeavor as new tools and skills are developed, and a potential employer should be looking not just for someone who knows what to do now, but who will also learn what to do later. In addition to applying what I had learned since initially completing these projects, I also had to learn entirely new skills to implement some of the features that I added to the artifacts.

	I hope that my portfolio of work speaks well of my abilities in the computer science field, and would like to thank you for taking the time to browse it. Below this text, you will find a review of the code that eventually became my artifacts. Links above this text will bring you to the artifacts, as well as my LinkedIn page, phone number, and email address. I hope you enjoy it!
