<h3>Narrative</h3>
<p>
	The project that I chose as the artifact for this section of the portfolio is a RESTful API that I made for my Client/Server Development class. The API was made in Python and is intended for use in MongoDB. Specifically, the API was made with a stocks database in mind. The original project had six main functions. The first four are the basic CRUD operations; creating, reading, updating and deleting documents. The create command took data from the URL used to curl the command and used it to make a new document in the database; the read, update, and delete commands would respectively print, update, or delete all documents with a given ticker symbol. The other two commands were more specialized; one displayed stock summaries by ticker symbol, and the other reported on the top five stocks in an industry of the user’s choice. These two commands were reliant on MongoDB’s pipeline functions.
</p>
<p>
	I selected this item to fill an artifact role in my portfolio because it demonstrates several skills that I want to place prominently for potential employers to see. First off, this project continues a theme with my other selections; the language once again changes in order to demonstrate my skills with multiple coding languages. In all, my portfolio now demonstrates my skills in the use of Python, C++, and Java; these are three of the most common coding languages across multiple industries, and being proficient in all three is an excellent skill to showcase. This specific project also demonstrates my ability to work with MongoDB in a way that could be of use to companies that work with it; being able to create and maintain an API that may be easier for other employees to use than MongoDB’s own interface is a useful skill. 
</p>
<p>
	My enhancements to the project are largely centered on demonstrating this latter skill in particular. The first major enhancement I made was to add supplementary read commands that allow for the use of search terms other than the ticker symbols. Specifically, I added commands that used the industry and sector values in addition to the two existing commands (which either searched based on ticker symbol or just printed the first document in the database. These additional search commands increase the program’s flexibility in terms of finding and grouping documents, making it a more genuinely useful tool for stocks research when used with the appropriate databases. The second major enhancement was the addition of more statistics to the pipeline functions; they now bring up significantly more information relevant to the stocks info than they were before, making them far more informative. I also added a third pipeline connected to a sector report feature; this functions similarly to the industry report pipeline, but groups documents by sector instead of by industry.
</p>
<p>
	 I would say that I met my goals from Module One handily with this project; my main goals were to make the program more useful in a professional setting, and I found a few different routes to that goal and took all of them. The main effect of this was providing the user with a lot more control over how documents are grouped and found when using the various functions of the program, which makes the program much more effective as a management tool. The API is decently fleshed out now, and I believe that it could conceivably see use in a professional setting. I would consider this set of enhancements to be successful.
</p>
<p>
	I didn’t have much trouble with this set of enhancements; this class was one of my most recent, so the work I had already done was still very fresh in my mind. Enhancing it further was pretty easy to handle with everything already recent in my memory. Overall, I would say that I’m very satisfied with the end results of my enhancements.
